I  just tested the V8502 with a UMC 6502A in my C128D-CR successfully:
- Risen from the Oblivion VIC
- Risen from the Oblivion VDC
- CPM VIC mode
- CPM 80 column mode
- Galaxian cartridge C64 mode
- Basic lesson loaded from tape
- C128 Diagnostic cartridge
- Elite 128

:x: **BEWARE: I got good CPLD's from China, but there are some XC9572XL FAKES out there!**

**For a WDC 65C02 you have to cut the small trace in the other solder jumper.**
